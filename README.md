### Self-Feeding And Adorable Item Rendering
- Wolves can automatically eat from their inventory to heal faster.

When wolves interact with items, they’ll also cutely hold them in their mouths.

### Shake Off Hazards
- Wolves are no longer defenseless against poison and fire!

They’ll instinctively shake off fire and poison, keeping them safe from these environmental hazards.

### Pet Summoning Whistle
- Never lose track of your loyal companions again! 

The Summoning Whistle calls all your pet wolves to your side, even if they are sitting or stuck in tricky places like caves.

### Immortal Loyalty
- Your wolves will never truly leave your side.

Wolves respawn when you sleep. Even if one dies while you’re away, it’ll still be saved for your next adventure.

### No More Friendly Fire
- Accidental hits are a thing of the past! 

Wolves no longer take damage from the player’s attacks.

### Your Friend In Need
- Wolves will now attempt to rescue the player and themselves with potions

Falling into lava or having critical health triggers the wolf to apply a fire resistance, regeneration or instant health potions.

### Stronger With Every Fight
- The wolves attack damage increases with each level-up. 

The wolf gains xp every time it kills a mob. Similar to the players level system, the wolf will require more and more xp for the next level up and resets upon death.

## Bugs

Known:
- Whistle sound does not fade out stereo by distance.
- Not a bug but the single bag item is ugly.
- Not a bug but the items and model textures should follow the same color pallet (depth) pattern as vanilla minecraft usually uses. 

At this development stage of the mod, you could run into bugs. If you noticed some, please feel free to let me know.

If you think there may be anything that would make the mod more enjoyable, please don't hesitate to make suggestions.

## Source Code
I plan to release the source code if enough people are interested or if the mod has been up for a while.

## Credits
Since this is my first mod, I would like to thank [@TurtyWurty](https://www.youtube.com/@TurtyWurty) on YouTube for jump-starting me for fabric modding by providing his tutorials.

This mod was inspired by the [Wolf Armor and Storage Mod](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/wolf-armor-and-storage) by [saturniidae](https://www.curseforge.com/members/saturniidae/projects) for older Versions of Minecraft (Forge).
