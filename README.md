# Better Wolf Companion Mod

**Tired of leaving your loyal wolves behind or worrying about their safety in your adventures? The Better Wolf Companion Mod brings a host of thoughtful upgrades to improve your furry friends' functionality, survivability, and charm in Minecraft! Whether you’re exploring caves or defending your base, this mod ensures your wolves are always by your side and ready for anything.**

## Features
### Portable Wolf Inventory
- Craft a stylish and functional **Wolf Bag** to grant your pet its own personal inventory storage.

Store food, items, and even unequip wolf armor directly in survival mode.

### Self-Feeding And Adorable Item Rendering
- Wolves can automatically eat from their inventory to heal faster.

When wolves interact with items (currently only with food), they’ll also cutely hold them in their mouths.

### Shake Off Hazards
- Wolves are no longer defenseless against poison and fire!

They’ll instinctively shake off fire and poison, keeping them safe from these environmental hazards.

### Pet Summoning Whistle
- Never lose track of your loyal companions again!

The Summoning Whistle calls all your pet wolves to your side, even if they are sitting or stuck in tricky places like caves.

### Immortal Loyalty
- Your wolves will never truly leave your side.

Wolves respawn when you sleep. Even if one dies while you’re away, it’ll still be saved for your next adventure.

### No More Friendly Fire
- Accidental hits are a thing of the past!

Wolves no longer take damage from the player’s attacks.

## Planned Features
Keep an eye out for future updates packed with even more exciting features!

- **Summon Far Away Wolves**: An upgraded whistle that retrieves wolves even from unloaded chunks.
- **Wolf Bed**: A cozy bed to anchor wolf respawning in specific locations.
- **Second Whistle Mode**: Easily despawn and respawn wolves at will.
- **Wolf XP System**: Wolves gain experience from battles, increasing their bite damage with time. (XP resets upon death.)
- **Wolf applying Potions and Totems to the player**: As a life saving effort the wolf tries everything to throw a fire resistance potion if you find yourself in lava or maybe even apply the Totem of Undying to you.
- Maybe some armor or maybe a dynamic armor adaptation from any player armor.

## Bugs

Known:
- Whistle sound does not fade out stereo by distance.
- Not a bug but the single bag item is ugly.
- Not a bug but the items and model textures should follow the same color pallet (depth) pattern as vanilla minecraft usually uses.

At this development stage of the mod, you could run into bugs. If you noticed some, please feel free to let me know.

If you think there may be anything that would make the mod more enjoyable, please don't hesitate to make suggestions.

## Source Code
I plan to release the source code if enough people are interested in it, the mod itself or if the mod has been up for a while.

## Credits
Since this is my first mod, I would like to thank [@TurtyWurty](https://www.youtube.com/@TurtyWurty) on YouTube for jump-starting me for fabric modding by providing his tutorials.

This mod was inspired by the [Wolf Armor and Storage Mod](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/wolf-armor-and-storage) by [saturniidae](https://www.curseforge.com/members/saturniidae/projects) for older Versions of Minecraft (Forge).
